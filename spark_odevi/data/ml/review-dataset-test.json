The closest relevance I have to items like these is while in the army I was trained in the camera rc bots. This thing is awesome we tested the range and got somewhere close to 50 yards without an issue. Getting the controls is a bit tricky at first but after about twenty minutes you get the feel for it. The drone comes just about fly ready you just have to sync the controller. I am definitely a fan of the drones now. Only concern I have is maybe a little more silent but other than that great buy.<br /><br />*Disclaimer I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review."}

We received a pair of cute girls gloves and a baseball ball instead, while we were expecting a boys batting tee. The gloves are cute, however made for at least 6+ yrs or above...more likely 8-9 yrs old girls.<br /><br />Can't provide a fair review as we were not able to use the product."}
